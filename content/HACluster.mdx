# How to Set Up an On-Prem HA Cluster Setup with Keepalived and MetalLB

## Disclaimer
This guide covers the steps for creating an on-premises Kubernetes cluster specifically for Ubuntu-based systems. If your machines are running any OS other than Ubuntu you might consider stopping reading.

## Introduction
Scaling applications effectively is a crucial part of your business. In most cases, major cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure have robust tools that help you scale your application. However in some scenarios, like mine, you might not have access to these cloud providers because of data privacy. Thus, in order to deploy and scale your application you will need on-prem cluster initialization. In this article, we will walk through how to set up an on-prem HA (High Availability) Kubernetes Cluster using Keepalived for control plane redundancy and MetalLB for load balancing services.

## Setting up your machines for the On-Prem Kubernetes Cluster

### Turning the swap off

Kubernetes watches the memory usage of the nodes and the pods in them. While the swap is on, Kubernetes might make some miscalculations about memory usage which leads to inefficiency in managing the Cluster.

You can turn the swap off by using a simple command:

```bash
swapoff -a
```

To make this change permanent you should edit the `/etc/fstab` file and comment out the line that starts with 'swap'.

### Getting the Containerd ready

Kubernetes manages containers in pods. To manage containers it needs Container Runtime. Containerd is one of the popular container runtime tools like Docker and CRI-O.

When Containerd is compared to Docker, it has more simplicity and efficiency.

#### Install Containerd  

```bash
sudo apt-get install containerd
```

This command will install the Containerd packages and start the containerd service. You can check if the Containerd service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status containerd
```

You should see the containerd service active and running. However, this is not enough for us to use the containerd along with our Kubernetes cluster.

#### Create containerd config.toml 

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/containerd
sudo containerd config default > /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

These two commands will create a config file for your containerd service.

Now we are going to edit the config file for our cluster initialization.

```bash
sed -i 's/SystemdCgroup = false/SystemdCgroup = true/g' /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

This command will set SystemCgroup true which comes as false by default. Kubernetes needs SystemCgroup to be turned on in order to manage containers.

> **Tip**: Also check if the Disable Plugins section on this config file has no value "cri".

Now you can restart your containerd service. 

```bash
sudo systemctl restart containerd
sudo systemctl enable containerd
```

Then check if it is running. 

```bash
sudo systemctl status containerd
```

### Install Kubelet, Kubeadm, Kubectl

Before installing these Kubernetes tools let's have a look and explain what they are and why we need them.

#### Kubelet

Kubelet is an agent that works on Kubernetes nodes and manages the lifecycle of pods and the containers running in them. It has a critical role in Cluster management. What does Kubelet do?
- Start and stop pods
- Control the containers in pods
- Report the pod and node situations to the Kubernetes API.

#### Kubectl

Kubectl is a command line tool that helps you manage Kubernetes resources like Pods, services, and configmaps.

#### Kubeadm

Kubeadm is a command line tool that helps you initialize and scale your Kubernetes cluster.

To install these tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo systemctl enable kubelet
```

Check the installation:

```bash
kubectl --version
```

> **Tip**: When you check the status of the Kubelet services it might be inactive or crashloop which is okay at that point. Kubeadm will take care of the missing components that make the Kubelet active and running.

### Some other configurations

To set up the Kubernetes cluster properly we should make some configurations including kernel modules and networking configurations.

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOF

sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter

systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl restart containerd
```

That is it! Our machine is now ready to initialize the Kubernetes cluster.

## Creating Cluster with Keepalived VIP 

In my case, we have 3 control plane nodes and to prevent some disaster we need to keep our cluster alive. Keepalived is a tool that provides High availability for your services. In essence, you create a VIP pool with available an IP address on your IP block and you set the Keepalived up on your nodes. One node becomes the master and the others the backup. When something unwanted happens to the master keepalived pod the VIP address you created is passed to the Backup node and the backup node turns itself into the Master node. You can decide which backup node has higher priority to claim the master node by setting the priority score on the keepalived manifest file.

And just like that by creating your Kubernetes cluster with the control-plane endpoint with VIP you have just set up you can create a high-availability cluster.

```bash
sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint="<IP>:6443" --upload-certs --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

> **Note**: To create your cluster with VIP control-plane endpoint you need to deploy your Keepalived pods as Static pods. After setting up your cluster you can check your network if the VIP is available:

```bash
ip a
```

## Setting up MetalLB

After we initialized our cluster and joined our other worker and control-plane nodes now, we can set up a load-balancer.

MetalLB is open-source software that provides load-balancing services for on-prem clusters. When you use cloud providers, these load-balancing services are provided by them, but in our case, we are setting up an on-prem cluster. If we want to build high-availability services with higher uptime within a high-availability cluster, we might need load-balancing. After setting up MetalLB we will be able to provide external IP for our Load-Balancer type of services.

> **Note**: You must have at least one worker node in your cluster to set up MetalLB.

### Pre-Flight Configurations

```bash
kubectl edit configmap -n kube-system kube-proxy
```

Change the configuration to:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeproxy.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: KubeProxyConfiguration
mode: "ipvs"
ipvs:
  strictARP: true
```

### Setting Up MetalLB

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.14.9/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml

kubectl create secret generic -n metallb-system memberlist --from-literal=secretkey="$(openssl rand -base64 128)"

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.14.9/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml

kubectl get pods -n metallb-system
```

Now let's create the IP address pool:

```bash
cat <<EOF > metallb-ipaddresspool.yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: first-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 10.3.95.100-10.3.95.150  # Set an available IP range from your IP block.
EOF

kubectl apply -f metallb-ipaddresspool.yaml
```

And set up the L2 advertisement:

```bash
cat <<EOF > metallb-l2advertisement.yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: l2-advert
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
  - first-pool
EOF

kubectl apply -f metallb-l2advertisement.yaml
```

### Check the result

```bash
kubectl get pods -n metallb-system
```

All pods should be up and running.

## Conclusion
By using Keepalived and MetalLB we have created a High-Availability Kubernetes Cluster. We have used VIP to set up our control plane and created Backup nodes for any cases. We have also set up MetalLB for our LoadBalancer type of services. Now you are able to deploy your pods and enjoy the high availability of your services.
